The Blue Yeti and similar Blue microphones come with **four polar pattern (pickup) modes** that control how the mic captures sound. These are selected via the **knob on the back** of the mic, often with icons instead of text.

Here’s what each setting does:

---

### 🎙️ 1. **Stereo Mode** (Icon: two overlapping circles)
- **Best for**: Vocals, instruments, ASMR, immersive sound.
- **How it works**: Uses **both left and right channels** to capture a **wide, directional soundscape**.
- **Captures**: Sound from the left and right sides—great for a **realistic, spatial feel**.

---

### 🎤 2. **Cardioid Mode** (Icon: heart shape)
- **Best for**: Podcasts, streaming, voiceovers, singing.
- **How it works**: Focuses on **sound in front of the mic**, blocking out sound from the sides and rear.
- **Captures**: Crisp, isolated audio—**great for solo recording** in noisy environments.

---

### 🗣️ 3. **Omnidirectional Mode** (Icon: circle)
- **Best for**: Conference calls, roundtable discussions, capturing ambient sounds.
- **How it works**: Picks up sound **equally from all directions**.
- **Captures**: A 360° field—**everything around the mic**.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 4. **Bidirectional Mode** (Icon: two opposing circles)
- **Best for**: Interviews, duets, face-to-face conversations.
- **How it works**: Captures sound from the **front and back**, but **not from the sides**.
- **Captures**: Great for two people sitting across from each other.

---

Each mode is optimized for different situations. For example:
- **Streaming?** Use **Cardioid**.
- **Group meeting?** Use **Omnidirectional**.
- **Interviewing someone across a desk?** Use **Bidirectional**.
- **Recording an acoustic guitar?** Try **Stereo**.

Let me know what you're using the mic for and I can recommend the best mode.
